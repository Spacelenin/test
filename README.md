# ShipWreck engine (linux) ⚓
###### Project Template for linux

## Description :open_book:

ShipWreck Engine is a project built to learn how graphical programming works. \
We have some basics features, and we want to add more and more new cool feature. \
The long term objective is to build an Engine that allow you to make a realistic animation \
via our render engine and making a game with the same project (but not the same render engine).

This is a template to make your project with ShipWreck Engine on linux platform. \
This repository contains all you need and doesn't contain any example. \
We have a [documentation][docs] to get started with our Engine. \
Check our repository (_Coming soon_) with all example and full of utilities
